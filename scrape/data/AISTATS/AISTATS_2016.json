As such, they have been successfully used to scale up clustering models such as K-Means and Gaussian mixture models to massive data sets. However, until now, the algorithms and the corresponding theory were usually specific to each clustering problem.  We propose a single, practical algorithm to construct strong coresets for a large class of hard and soft clustering problems based on Bregman divergences. This class includes hard clustering with popular distortion measures such as the Squared Euclidean distance, the Mahalanobis distance, KL-divergence and Itakura-Saito distance. The corresponding soft clustering problems are directly related to popular mixture models due to a dual relationship between Bregman divergences and Exponential family distributions. Our theoretical results further imply a randomized polynomial-time approximation scheme for hard clustering.

In this paper, we study the reducibility of submodular functions, a property that enables us to reduce the solution space of submodular optimization problems without performance loss. We introduce the concept of reducibility using marginal gains. Then we show that by adding perturbation, we can endow irreducible functions with reducibility, based on which we propose the perturbation-reduction optimization framework. Our theoretical analysis proves that given the perturbation scales, the reducibility gain could be computed, and the performance loss has additive upper bounds. We further conduct empirical studies and the results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly accelerates existing optimization methods for irreducible submodular functions with a cost of only small performance losses.\n  ", "embedding_sci_bert": "None", "embedding_sent_bert": "None", "embedding_specter": "None", "img_large": "None", "img_small": "None"}, {"id": "nitanda16", "conf_name": "AISTATS", "year": "2016", "link": "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/nitanda16.html", "pdf": "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/nitanda16.pdf", "type": "None", "title": "Accelerated Stochastic Gradient Descent for Minimizing Finite Sums", "authors": ["Atsushi Nitanda"], "abstract": "\n    We propose an optimization method for minimizing the finite sums of smooth convex functions.

However, these methods often lead to non-convex optimization and to intractable number of optimization parameters.  In this paper, we propose a new non-linear MKL method that utilizes nuclear norm regularization and leads to convex optimization problem. The proposed Nuclear-norm-Constrained MKL (NuC-MKL) algorithm converges faster, and requires smaller number of calls to an SVM solver, as compared to other competing methods. Moreover, the number of the model support vectors in our approach is usually much smaller, as compared to other methods. This suggests that our algorithm is more resilient to overfitting.

However, the link function formalism is restrictive, link functions are always invertible and must convert a parameter of interest to an linear combination of the underlying processes. There are many likelihoods and models where a non-linear combination is more appropriate. We term these more general models \"Chained Gaussian Processes\": the transformation of the GPs to the likelihood parameters will not generally be invertible, and that implies that linearisation would only be possible with multiple (localized) links, i.e a chain. We develop an approximate inference procedure for Chained GPs that is scalable and applicable to any factorized likelihood.

We propose a new method, SILO, for fitting prediction-time local models that uses supervised neighborhoods that adapt to the local shape of the regression surface. To learn such neighborhoods, we use a weight function between points derived from random forests. We prove the consistency of SILO, and demonstrate through simulations and real data that our method works well in both the serial and distributed settings. In the latter case, SILO learns the weighting function in a divide-and-conquer manner, entirely avoiding communication at training time.\n  ", "embedding_sci_bert": "None", "embedding_sent_bert": "None", "embedding_specter": "None", "img_large": "None", "img_small": "None"}, {"id": "zhang16b", "conf_name": "AISTATS", "year": "2016", "link": "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/zhang16b.html", "pdf": "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/zhang16b.pdf", "type": "None", "title": "Global Convergence of a Grassmannian Gradient Descent Algorithm for Subspace Estimation", "authors": ["Dejiao Zhang", "Laura Balzano"], "abstract": "\n    It has been observed in a variety of contexts that gradient descent methods have great success in solving low-rank matrix factorization problems, despite the relevant problem formulation being non-convex.

This is particularly attractive since it means that learning an SPN from data always yields a tractable model for inference. However, existing parameter learning algorithms for SPNs operate in batch mode and do not scale easily to large datasets. In this work, we explore online algorithms to ensure that parameter learning can also be done tractably with respect to the amount of data.

The original problem is then broken into simpler and parallel tasks, while guaranteeing the monotonic reduction of the original objective function and convergence to a local minimum. This framework also allows one to restrict the upper bound to a local dynamic convex domain, so that the bound is better matched to the local curvature of the objective function, resulting in accelerated convergence.

An appealing alternative is to use tractable probabilistic models, such as arithmetic circuits (ACs) and sum-product networks (SPNs), in which marginal and conditional queries can be answered efficiently.  In this paper, we present the first discriminative structure learning algorithm for ACs, DACLearn (Discriminative AC Learner).  Like previous work on generative structure learning, DACLearn finds a log-linear model with conjunctive features, using the size of an equivalent AC representation as a learning bias.  Unlike previous work, DACLearn optimizes conditional likelihood, resulting in a more accurate conditional distribution.  DACLearn also learns much more compact ACs than generative methods, since it does not need to represent a consistent distribution over the evidence variables.  To ensure efficiency, DACLearn uses novel initialization and search heuristics to drastically reduce the number of feature evaluations required to learn an accurate model.  In experiments on 20 benchmark domains, we find that our DACLearn learns models that are more accurate and compact than other tractable generative and discriminative methods.\n  ", "embedding_sci_bert": "None", "embedding_sent_bert": "None", "embedding_specter": "None", "img_large": "None", "img_small": "None"}, {"id": "li16g", "conf_name": "AISTATS", "year": "2016", "link": "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/li16g.html", "pdf": "http://proceedings.mlr.press/v51/li16g.pdf", "type": "None", "title": "One Scan 1-Bit Compressed Sensing", "authors": ["Ping Li"], "abstract": "\n    Based on \u03b1-stable random projections with small \u03b1, we develop a simple algorithm for compressed sensing (sparse signal recovery) by utilizing only the signs (i.e., 1-bit) of the measurements.  Using only 1-bit information of the measurements  results in substantial cost reduction  in collection, storage, communication, and decoding for compressed sensing.  The proposed algorithm is efficient in that the decoding procedure requires only one scan of the coordinates. Our analysis can precisely show that, for a K-sparse signal of length N, 12.3K\\log N/\u03b4measurements (where \u03b4is the confidence) would be sufficient for recovering the support and the signs of the signal. While the method is highly robust against typical measurement noises, we also provide the analysis of the scheme under   random flipping of the signs of  measurements.
